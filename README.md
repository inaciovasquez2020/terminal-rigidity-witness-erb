## Significance Statement
The **TRW–ERB** project provides the formalization of the Einstein–Rosen Bridge (ERB) as the canonical **Terminal Rigidity Witness**. Within the Unified Rigidity Framework, the ERB is identified as a unique zero-capacity physical witness. This repository constructs the **Terminal Witness Functor** into the SIGC (Structural Information/Geometric Capacity) preorder, proving that topological censorship forces the collapse of information throughput to zero.

## Key Results
* **The Zero-Capacity Theorem:** Deriving the absolute zero-capacity property from topological censorship axioms.
* **Terminal Witness Functor:** A categorical mapping from ERB manifolds into the SIGC preorder.
* **Paradigm Integration:** Reconciliation of black hole information paradoxes through explicit capacity accounting and structural rigidity.

## Contents
* **`trw-erb-sigc.tex`**: LaTeX source of the formal URF-SIGC specification.
* **`trw-erb-sigc.pdf`**: The compiled, citable artifact defining the terminal witness.
* **Structural Proof:** This artifact represents a frozen logical resolution; no computational simulation is required as the result is derived from topological invariants.

## Mathematical Context
In the URF ecosystem, the ERB serves as the "Lower Bound" of the Rigidity Wall. While other systems maintain a spectral gap $\lambda_1 > 0$, the TRW–ERB represents the limit where the geometric capacity $C \to 0$, serving as the universal reference for zero-throughput regimes.
