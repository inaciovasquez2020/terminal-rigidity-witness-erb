# Terminal Rigidity Witness — ERB

This repository contains a formalization of the Einstein–Rosen Bridge (ERB)
as a Terminal Rigidity Witness (TRW–ERB) within the Unified Rigidity Framework (URF).

It includes:

- `trw-erb-sigc.tex`: LaTeX source of the formal specification
- `trw-erb-sigc.pdf`: Compiled PDF artifact

This document defines the ERB as a canonical zero-capacity physical witness,
constructs the Terminal Witness Functor into the SIGC preorder, derives
the zero-capacity property from topological censorship, and integrates
black hole information paradigms with explicit capacity accounting.
